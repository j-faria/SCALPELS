# SCALPELS
Self-Correlation Analysis of Line Profiles for Extracting Low-amplitude Shifts

An implementation of the algorithm proposed by [Collier Cameron et al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00018).

- [x] Calculate ACFs from CCFs
- [x] SVD decomposition of ACFs
- [x] Project observed RVs onto k principal components
- [ ] Estimate optimal k using BIC
- [ ] Model stellar variability and planetary motion simultaneously
